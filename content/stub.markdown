For the majority of this week I have been focusing on adding a rudimentary blogging engine to my site, allowing me to post updates such as this.

There are many different options out there for blogging, from small but powerful Node.js modules such as [Wheat][] to plugin heavy behemoths like Wordpress. However, since developing this site has partly been a learning exercise, I thought I would have a go at developing my own blogging engine - one that would allow me to customise to my own requirements as I went along.
